Korean tracks show highest average popularity (27.55/100)

English dominates volume (23,392 tracks, 37.5% share) but has optimization potential

Emerging markets (Hindi, Malayalam, Telugu) show significant growth opportunities

🏭 Audio Feature Portfolio Analysis
Energy shows strongest positive correlation with popularity (r=0.148)

Danceability and valence have moderate positive relationships

Acousticness demonstrates negative correlation with popularity

Identified optimal feature combinations for different language markets

# 💰 Popularity Optimization Opportunities
High-popularity outliers (2,888 tracks) are 5.0x more popular than average

Key differentiators: +0.040 danceability, +0.083 energy, higher tempo (120.6 BPM)

Significant potential for replicating successful patterns across languages

# ⭐ Musical Characteristic Enhancement
Energy optimization identified as primary lever for popularity improvement

Danceability balance crucial across different language preferences

Tempo variations show market-specific optimal ranges

# 📅 Temporal Trend Analysis
Historical analysis from 1971-2024 reveals evolving musical preferences

Recent trends show popularity score variations year-over-year

Production patterns indicate strategic release timing opportunities
